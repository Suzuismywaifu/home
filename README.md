this this the 5th version of my homepage. this is everything I wanted to create about 10 years ago. 

Version 5.1: Time dependant darkmode added and main item box length unified 

Version 5.2: small edits

Version 5.3: added buttons to remove text and some of the code is cleaned I guess or whatever 

Version 5.4: added an option to hide image (replaced with another image), one of the dropdowns, and while in mobile click the label and have it collapse

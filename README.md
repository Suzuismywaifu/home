this this the 5th version of my homepage. this is everything I wanted to create about 10 years ago. 

Version 5.1: Time dependant darkmode added and main item box length unified 

Version 5.2: small edits

Version 5.3: added buttons to remove text and some of the code is cleaned I guess or whatever 

Version 5.4: added an option to hide image (replaced with another image), one of the dropdowns, and while in mobile click the label and have it collapse 

Version 6: rebuilt because bugs couldn't be fixed. layout is basically the same, mobile mode's dropdowns actually close when tapped lable is tapped, new background image applied, random kaomoji between two elements in mobile mode, click the random image 3 time to swap to darkmode temporally

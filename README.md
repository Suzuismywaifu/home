Version 6: rebuilt because bugs couldn't be fixed. layout is basically the same, mobile mode's dropdowns actually close when tapped lable is tapped, new background image applied, random kaomoji between two elements in mobile mode, click the random image 3 time to swap to darkmode temporally 

6.2: changed things and mobile mode broke. it's fixed now

version 6.3: removed dorkmode - didn't like it, so its gonezo. New images load when clicked
